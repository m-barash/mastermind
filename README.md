A ruby command line take on the classic board game (from The Odin Project)
A WikiHow on how to play the board game: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind
And a playable version is here: http://www.webgamesonline.com/mastermind/index.php

At this point, the game works as such:
- Computer selects a random sequence of colors (duplicates are allowed)
- Player has 12 turns to guess the correct sequence
- Each turn, player gets feedback on whether he guessed the color and position correctly, or just the color with incorrect position
- Player wins if he can guess the correct sequence before the 12 turns are over
